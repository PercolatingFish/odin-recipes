    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>It's just rice porridge.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups steamed rice</li>
        <li>1 cup dashi</li>
        <li>2 tsp soy sauce</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>

    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine the rice, dashi, and 1 cup water in a saucepan and bring to a simmer over medium-high heat.  Drop the heat to low and cook at a very gentle simmer, stirring occasionally, until most of the liquid has been absorbed or evaporated, about 8 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add another cup of water and cook, stirring occasionally, until the rice has broken down into a thick porridge, about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir in the soy sauce and salt.  Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the beaten egg.  Divide between two bowls and garnish as desired.</li>
